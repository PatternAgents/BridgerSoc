PatternAgents BridgerSoc lets you control (or monitor) switches, relays, lights, LEDs, 
LED string lights, stepper motors, and more! 
BridgerSoc (System-On-Chip) can directly control sixteen (16) high power darlington outputs, 
based on analog/digital inputs, such as sensors, switches, or potentiometers - 
simple to use for your projects, with no programming required.  
BridgerSoc works with any Arduino CPU as a shield, but it doesn't need one to work standalone.
